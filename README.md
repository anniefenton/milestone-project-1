# Foraging Website

## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of this website is to advertise the services of *Foraging Cardiff* (an imagined organisation) to their new and returning customers, as well as to potential guides. *Foraging Cardiff* hosts guided foraging walks across the city that are suitable for families, couples, and adults alike. 

### User Goals
1. #### New participant

A new participant would be someone who wants to learn about foraging and is keen to go on a guided walk to learn more about what they can forage in their local area.

2. #### Returning participant

Someome who has already been on one, or a few, guided walks and is returning to the website to find out about future walks. Additionally they could be looking to share the site with a friend, find the organisation's social media links, or learn more about common foraged plants.

3. #### Guides

A *Foraging Cardiff* guide would use the site to find out the dates and times of walks, as well as logging into their guide profile. Potential guides would use the site to find out about the organisation, and register their interest in becoming a guide. 

### Developer and Business goals
1. #### Business

*Foraging Cardiff* is looking to increase their customer base and share the art of foraging. They believe in the power of plants to promote health and wellbeing, and believe in the herbal and medicinal properties of plants. Through guided walks they hope to share the knowledge of plants they have built up over the years, and ensure longevity of the art of foraging. They also want to provide employment to guides who have this knowledge.

2. #### Developer

The developer wants to build her skillset by designing this website. She wants to create a fit-for-purpose, fully functioning site that would add to her portfolio of work and showcase her eye for design.

### User Stories

As a new customer and forager I want:

- to learn about foraging in my local area.
- to learn more about the organisation and their values.
- a website in which I can easily see the dates, times, and locations of walks.
- to be able to sign up to the mailing list and find the organisation's social links.
- to see the pricing of these walks.

As a returning customer and forager I want:

- a website in which I can easily see the dates, times, and locations of walks.
- the ability to see images of commonly foraged plants on the website.

As a potential guide I want:

- to find out about the organisation's values and interests to see if they match up to mine.
- to see the schedule of current walks to see if I could add to it.
- To register my interest as a new guide.

## Features
### Existing Features

- A bold landing page to simulate the user 'stepping into' a forest and the site. This would only feature once when entering the site and the navigation links wouldn't direct to this to maintain a smooth user experience.
- A header featuring the logo and navigation links of the site.
- An 'About us' page where users find out about the organiation, the schedule of foraging walks, and pricing of them.
- A gallery section featuring images and descriptions of some commonly foraged plants. A disclaimer would also feature here as well as a warning message to not 'munch on a hunch'.
- A contact page where users can sign up to the organisation's mailing list, and where potential guides can regsiter their interest.

### Features left to implement
- Area for existing guides to manage their walks, profiles etc.
- user profiles where they document what plants they have foraged.
