# Foraging Website

## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of this website is to advertise the services of *Foraging Cardiff* (an imagined organisation) to their new and returning customers, as well as to potential guides. *Foraging Cardiff* hosts guided foraging walks across the city that are suitable for families, couples, and adults alike. 

### User Goals
1. #### New participant

A new participant would be someone who wants to learn about foraging and is keen to go on a guided walk to learn more about what they can forage in their local area.

2. #### Returning participant

Someome who has already been on one, or a few, guided walks and is returning to the website to find out about future walks. Additionally they could be looking to share the site with a friend, find the organisation's social media links, or learn more about common foraged plants.

3. #### Guides

A *Foraging Cardiff* guide would use the site to find out the dates and times of walks, as well as logging into their guide profile. Potential guides would use the site to find out about the organisation, and register their interest in becoming a guide. 

### Developer and Business goals
1. #### Business

*Foraging Cardiff* is looking to increase their customer base and share the art of foraging. They believe in the power of plants to promote health and wellbeing, and believe in the herbal and medicinal properties of plants. Through guided walks they hope to share the knowledge of plants they have built up over the years, and ensure longevity of the art of foraging. They also want to provide employment to guides who have this knowledge.

2. #### Developer

The developer wants to build her skillset by designing this website. She wants to create a fit-for-purpose, fully functioning site that would add to her portfolio of work.
